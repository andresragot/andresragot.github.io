                <span class="title-project">ABOUT ME</span>
                <p>One of my very first memories from my childhood was when my big cousin handed me over his 64 controller because he was playing Ocarina of Time, and I was by his side. Since that exact moment, video games in general have been over my head all the time. Even if I am not thinking about them, I am thinking about the second best thing I love, and that is doing them. Or more specifically, how to do them.</p>
                <p>All the curiosity turned me into the professional I am today, which is very eager to learn a lot about video games, and will never not want to keep learning.</p>

                <p>In 2017, I embarked on a life experience, leaving my country with 17 years and studying in <a href="https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en/">INSA de Lyon</a>. However, in 2021, I started what will become my main focus at <a href="https://udit.es/estudios/grado-oficial/diseno-y-desarrollo-de-videojuegos/">UDIT</a>, studying a bachelor’s degree in video game design and development.</p>
                <p>I have learnt many things along the way, gathered new insights and different perspectives. I have also mastered new languages, new engines, new tools, met new people, improved my coding abilities. In my spare time, I work on personal projects which either way I am always learning.</p>
                <p>My passion for video games has driven me to pursue a career in this field. I am always eager to learn more and improve my skills. I hope to create innovative and engaging games that will entertain and inspire others.</p><img alt="" class="rsTmb" src="../images/picture.jpg">
